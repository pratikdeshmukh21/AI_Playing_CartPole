🚀 Excited to share my latest project! 🌟

I’ve built an AI model that learns to play the classic CartPole game using Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks! 🧠🎮

This project was an incredible journey, combining mathematical intuition, coding, and problem-solving to train an agent that balances the pole like a pro!

Key highlights:
✅ Implemented a robust neural network for decision-making.
✅ Utilized reinforcement learning to teach the AI through trial and error.
✅ Built and trained the model in [Google Colab/VS Code – modify based on your platform].

This experience not only deepened my understanding of AI and ML concepts but also reinforced the importance of patience and persistence when working on dynamic systems.

I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions on improving this project! Let's connect and discuss more about the exciting world of AI! 🌐💡
